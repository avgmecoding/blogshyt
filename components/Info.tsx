      I’m Rajshri — a computer science undergraduate who enjoys building things that
      live on the internet and actually make sense. I like working close to the
      fundamentals, understanding how systems behave rather than just making them
      work, and refining ideas until they feel simple, intentional, and usable.
      Over time, I’ve grown more interested in crafting interfaces and backends that
      feel quiet but solid — products that don’t shout, yet stay reliable when it
      matters.
